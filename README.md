Real Time Bus Tracker



Description:   

This webpage was designed with simplicity in mind so that you can easily view and keep track of the positions of a few active buses in the Boston, MA area. 

Use:

There is not much to it. Once you visit the site you will be presented with a map in the middle of the page and some bus pins moving around the map itself every 15 seconds.

Roadmap:

In future editions the bus numbers will be added to the moving bus pins, clicking on the buses will take you to a street view of exactly there that bus is and finally links will be added so you can view buses in other busy cities.
